# Website for linto.app

## This is a jekyll project

So it's also a ruby project.

So you need to install ruby and gem.

Then install bundler with `gem install bundler --user`

Then install the project with `<path_of_bundle> install`

The rest of the documentation can be found on jekyll website https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ but the main command to know is `<path_of_bundle> exec jekyll serve`
